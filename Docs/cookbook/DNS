How to install an ISC BIND 9 server
===================================

Prerequisites:
==============

  You must have the following software packages available:

  * Bind version 9
  * Subversion client (server functionality not needed)
  * CRON - to periodically update the tables
    (While you can use other methods to run the update process,
     this recipe will only cover cron)

Prerequisite Notes:
===================

  Bind 9 is easily built from source but many distributions contain a
  prepackaged install. Many times this is preferable since security updates
  to bind will naturally come with the distribution.

  The SVN client is not nearly as critical to patch as BIND and is also easy
  to build. Since the server functionality is not needed you can build svn
  without building against BerkelyDB. For some space critical applications this
  is handy.

  CRON is a well used system that has many alternatives. On platforms such as
  OSX (Leopard and higher) cron is completely replaced with launchd. Solaris
  uses services which may provide a more robust way of managing updates, but
  cron still works well.

Application Notes:
==================

  BIND 9 has an administrative client functionality called "rndc". One
  subcommand of rndc is "reload" which tells a running BIND 9 server to attempt
  to refresh its configuration. A special property of this is that if the
  refresh fails, BIND will keep the old configuration. This is arguably much
  safer than restarting bind as many default distributions scripts will do
  (including the Solaris 10 SMF description.) For this reason it is recommended
  that you configure rndc for your DNS server.

Overview:
=========

  This setup works by periodically polling a svn server and then running
  "rndc reload". Due to hard coded paths in the dns configuration the subversion
  repository must be checked out at /etc/bind as the examples dictate.

Installation:
=============

  To modify an existing configuration:

    1) Find the path to your named.conf configuration file for your installation
       of bind9. If you compiled bind9 yourself then the default should be
       {prefix}/etc/named.conf, otherwise refer to your systems documentation on
       the topic.

    2) Clean out any references to zone configurations, acl entries, and views.
       You may keep your rndc configuration as well as global configuration
       options.

    3) Checkout the subversion repository at the location "/etc/bind". If your
       repository exists at "http://example.com/svn/bind" then you would run:

       # svn co http://examples.com/svn/bind /etc/bind

       (Sanity check that /etc/bind/named.conf exists/is from the repository)

    4) Edit your distribution's named.conf and add an include to the svn
       repository checkout by adding the line:

       include "/etc/bind/named.conf";

  To start from a fresh configuration replace step 2 from above with:

    2) Start with an empty named.conf and configure your rndc settings.
       # cd /bind/configuration/path
       # rndc-confgen > rndc.conf)
       # cat rndc.conf > named.conf
       # vi named.conf
         ( follow directions in the named.conf )

    Once done with step 4 from above you will likely have a named.conf that
    looks similar to:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ----  sample named.conf ----------------------------------------------------
    key "rndc-key" {
          algorithm hmac-md5;
          secret "eo+Al6pfUX3ByNqLoKGQ7Q==";
    };
    
    controls {
          inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
                  allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "rndc-key"; };
    };
    
    include "/etc/bind/named.conf";
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You can now start bind as prescribed by your installation. This may vary between
  operating systems, some examples are given below:

    Vanilla Unix:
      # /etc/init.d/bind9 start

    Solaris 10+:
      # svcadm enable svc:/network/dns/server:default

Configure CRON:
===============

  Create an entry to run
    "svn update /etc/bind;rndc reload"
  at an interval that suits your needs. It is recommended to put full paths for
  the svn and rndc commands to ensure that the correct binary is run in any
  case. Example cron entries may look like:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ---- example root crontab ----------------------------------------------------
  10,40 * * * * /opt/csw/bin/svn update /etc/bind > /dev/null
  15,45 * * * * /opt/csw/sbin/rndc reload > /dev/null
  ## Check the status of DNS before everyone goes home (m-f)
  46 16 * * 1-5 /opt/csw/sbin/rndc status
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Run these commands in a minimal shell to ensure that they work properly.

Testing the Installation:
=========================

  Since your new DNS scheme supports views, you may not get the results you
  expect if you query against "127.0.0.1". It is recommended that you run your
  query from another host or minimally from the same host using the published
  address.

  # dig hostname.example.com @192.0.2.2 ANY
