Common Tasks:
=============

To add/remove/modify host entries you can follow the recipe:

  ./05-update-source
  ./10-edit-hosts
  ./30-update-zones
  ./35-check-changes (this is optional)
  ./60-commit-changes

  Each stage should guide you to the next.

Uncommon Tasks:
===============

To add hand crafted entries that do not fit in the normal scheme:

  edit views/{network}/headers/db-{zone name}
  svn commit
  update ns servers (automatically done via cron)

To add a new domain:

  edit res/db/domain_list.xml
    (pattern match to add new entry from existing domain)
  run res/db/update_other

To add a new network:

  edit res/db/network_list.xml
    (pattern match to add new entry from existing network)
  run res/db/update_other

Important Files:
================

This tree shows how files are included from /etc/bind/named.conf
most files are automatically generated, exceptions are noted below.

 | /etc/bind/named.conf    -- hand generated general/global parameters to bind
 |                            are placed here
 \-| /etc/bind/named.acls  -- groups of hosts/networks are defined here for
   |    		      later use
   | /etc/bind/named.views -- each view of the DNS tree is defined here with
   |    		      options
   \-| /etc/bind/views/{network}/named.conf
     |  		   -- Simplified named.conf file for each network view
     \-| /etc/bind/reverse/global-named.conf
     | |		   -- config for reverse resolution of
     | |		      all networks in all contexts
     | \-| /etc/bind/reverse/headers/ipv[4|6]-{network}
     |   |                 -- config for reverse resolution of a
     |   |                    single network
     |   \-| /etc/bind/reverse/zones/ipv[4|6]-{network}
     |                     -- config for reverse resolution of a

     \-| /etc/bind/view/{network}/extra-reverse.conf
     |                     -- config for special zones
     \-| /etc/bind/view/{network}/headers/db-{zone name}
       |                   -- header for zone
       \-| /etc/bind/views/{network}/zones/db-{zone name}
                           -- zone definition file
