update_zones.py automatically creates dhcp tables for ip ranges that it finds
in the net_list.xml file. The files are named after their network name in the
same file. eg:

A network named: internal

That has and IPv4 range of: 192.168.0.0/24

will have a file generated named: tables/ipv4_internal

The contents of the file include only hosts with a macAddress entry.


IPv6 is almost supported but the final pieces have not been tested as we do not
have a production DHCPv6 install and many clients still do not have solid
support for the protocol.

tables/ipv6_internal
  -- will contain entries that have a dhcp6.client-id record


Using these tables with your ISC DHCP server should be as simple as including
them. You may choose to include one or all of the networks as suits your
environment.
